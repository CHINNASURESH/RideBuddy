Location Sharing and Tracking App
Tracking friends while traveling in different Groups / vehicles is cumbersome 
 inorder make it easy Ride buddy app allows user can create a group and share his location to his group for selected time period and other group members can do the same. 

Set time intervals for location refresh (10/5/3/live) in minutes set 10 minutes as default view.

Groups can be formed by mobile nos/mail ID or any google authentication. Adding and inviting group members by using user contacts/Mail Id.

Simple google map layout with share my location option via social media, text, mail. based on users choice. 

every member mutualy shares theirs and views other members location.

member can stop sharing location on their choice..

Let the flow be like one member log in and clicks share location option and proceeds to share it thru social media to his buddy. his buddy accepts and clicks the link and now able to view his friends location now buddy can decide whether to share his location in the same way.
allow as many as users to share and view the location of their friends in a single screen. i.e if ten people in the group sharing thier locations means all ten can view all ten friends location
